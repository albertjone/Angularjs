# 
in angularjs project there exsit tow catergories of files:one is script file 
and the other one is html template.

as our project goes to be bigger,  the project will go to be complex. So it is 
necessary to group the files. The common strategies are package by feature and 
package by layer.
but most project will chose the later one. So will make another directory 
layout on branch b.
